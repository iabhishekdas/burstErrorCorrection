The Verilog codes in this repository are part of a research work with Dr. Nur Touba in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Universtity of Texas at Austin.

More details about the codes can be found in the paper below. Please use the citation if you plan to use this work.
A. Das and N. A. Touba, "Low Complexity Burst Error Correcting Codes to Correct MBUs in SRAMs", in Proc. of ACM Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI (GLSVLSI), pp. 219-224, 2018.

The codes are simple structural Verilog models along with a Verilog testbench to exhaustively test them. The main codes are synthesizeable and have been synthesized originally using Synopsys DC.

The file names are in the format n<total_bits>k<data_bits>b<burst_size>.v for the Verilog code and n<total_bits>k<data_bits>b<burst_size>tb.v for its corresponding testbench.
